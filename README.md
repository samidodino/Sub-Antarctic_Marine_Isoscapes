# Sub-Antarctic_Marine_Isoscapes
Stable isotope spatial patterns for the Southwest Atlantic Ocean towards polar waters. Riccialdelli et. al 2024. Progress in Oceangrapgy, under review.

To differentiate five marine areas from the Southwest Atlantic Ocean towards oceanic and polar waters, a key foraging area for many marine consumers, we built isoscapes at different spatial scales using carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope values of phytoplankton, zooplankton and particulate organic matter in sediment. We analyzed the isotopic variability between marine areas in terms of oceanographic parameters (e.g. temperature, salinity) and geographical sampling site data (e.g. latitude, longitude).

This repository contains scripts used to analyze the isotopic variability between marine areas in terms of oceanographic parameters.

Files:

Satellital images: extract_sst_chla_depth.R. This script provides the code to extract data from satellite images 

Models to compare isotopic variability: models_comparison_SIAvalues.R. This script provides all the Generalized Least Square (GLS) models used to compare SIA values using a Large, Regional and Local approaches.

Merge bathymetry rasters: merge_rasters_bathymetry.R. This script provides the code to produce the DBM mosaic of the bathymetry rasters.
